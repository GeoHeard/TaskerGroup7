Matters Arising
——————————————————————

    - Looked into breaking down the functional requirement given to us via the documents      and started breaking them down to gain a better understanding of what is required and what needs to be tested
    - Testing is based entirely around each functional requirement, and is there to make sure all them are working as specified


Actions Arising
——————————————————————

    - Need to assign group members a functional requirement each which they will be responsible for completing via the Google Doc provided
