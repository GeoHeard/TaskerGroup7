Matters Arising
——————————————————————————————————

	-	Scroll bar along with the list of tasks so all tasks are viewable on the nabber
	-	User can click on tasks, and can then view all the details of the task, such as subtasks a date of issue and a date of completion etc
	-	Create new button at the top of the navbar for allowing for the creation of tasks by the user
	-	The active panel would be where all functionality within the site is done, such as creating tasks, viewing and editing tasks and removing and managing team members etc
	-	When team member management is selected the navbar will change to a list of team members rather than tasks and the user can use this to select specific users and view them in the active panel
