Matters Arising
-----------------------------------------------

	◦	Database will be worked on by Edward and Ivan (with help from anyone who is proficient in database creation)
	◦	The Web app aspect is for use by the manager only to designate the users/workers with tasks, the users themselves will not actually use the web app
	◦	Users on the desktop app can edit the completion of the task, such as mark certain actions as being done
	◦	Later on consider authentication and authorisation within the app
	◦	Ask Wayne whether multiple team members can be assigned to one task
	◦	Whether on completion the manager should be pinged and set the task as completed
	◦	We need to look into reallocation of tasks to other users, and whether we need to put this as part of ‘abandoned’ status 
	◦	Whether the user should be able to add a comment/reason when they decide to abandon a task and then the manager can decide whether he actually wants to abandon/reallocate the task
	◦	Whether or not we need to have a more advanced filter/search functionality 
	◦	If user needs to have a password alongside their e-mail, or whether the e-mail being recorded locally is enough security
	◦	The desktop application needs to store data locally in case there is no network connection, also a task being edit should cause automatic synchronisation and if not every 5 minutes the app should be synched anyway
	◦	HTTP? FTP?
	◦	Use GitHub to allow us to edit all each others code and also get a good insight into how we’ve implemented code along with comment people put with code itself
	◦	The app should be able to handle 20 team members and 30 allocated tasks
